                                Hello! My name is Adam Gencarelli, and I'm a Software Engineering student currently studying at <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/" target="_blank">Western University.</a> I am in my fifth and final year of study after recently completing a 16-month internship as a Software Developer at <a href="https://www.ibm.ca/" target="_blank">IBM Canada.</a> Starting May 2017, I will be actively seeking full time employment as a Software Engineer. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I consider myself to be a very dedicated individual. As an intern at IBM, I was thrust into a difficult product <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/business-process-manager-family" target="_blank">(IBM Business Process Manager)</a> with little time to learn my role and begin contributing. I was able to quickly adapt to my new environment, proving to my team that I could be an effective developer for them. I was able to grow with my team, starting in a software testing role and moving up to a junior developer. I developed a plethera of valuable skills that I will now look to transfer into new and exciting roles as a full time software engineer. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I began coding in my first year of engineering by learning C++. I immediately developed a love for programming, and I constantly chose to be working on fun programming tasks rather than my school assignments. The one thing I love the most about programming is that though it is a career, it feels like I get to play a game for my job. Solving difficult problems is more like a challenging puzzle to me, and implementing a new website is exciting to create and design. Because of this, I am motivated to continue to improve my skills and discover new quirks about what I do. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Outside of work, I enjoy dabbling in several different sports, such as volleyball, hockey, soccer, ultimate frisbee, or football. I enjoy getting together with friends to watch big sports games, or the latest episode of Game of Thrones. I also enjoy spending time teaching others about different technologies. I have <a href="/skills">volunteered</a> with two organizations to provide guidance and tutorials on new web frameworks, which I find very rewarding. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My biggest aspirations in life are to graduate as a software engineer, find a job working on a product that I love with the ability to see my code in action, and to get a puppy.
